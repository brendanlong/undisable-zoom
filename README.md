## Undisable zoom

For some reason, W3C though it would be useful if web sites could
disable zooming. Naturally, designers decided that all websites
should do this because it makes their design prettier or something.

The author of this addon thinks users should be able to decide for
themselves if they want to zoom, so this addon disables disabling
zoom on all pages.

## Side effects

This probably breaks pages that legitimately use zooming (like
maps and some games). I consider this a worthwhile tradeoff, but
I'd be willing to add a whitelist if there were pull requests for
it. Absolutely no text pages will ever be whitelisted.
